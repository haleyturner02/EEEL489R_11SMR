# DA14531MOD Bluetooth Low-Energy Modules 
The BLE modules will be programmed and debugged using SWD interface from an external processeser on EK-RA2E1 Development Board. Once programmed, BLE modules will communicate with each device's main code (Parent/Child) via UART1 on the MCUs. 

Note: ble_app_peripheral project from SDK 6.0.16 used as starting project for Child BLE Modules, only modified files are included in this directory
