# WLR089U0 Transceivers
The transceivers will be programmed and debugged using an external processor with a SWD interface. Once programmed, the transceiver on the Parent Device will transmit data to the transceiver at the Base Station. This data will be communicated from the Parent Device main code to the transceiver via UART.
The base station is able to view data using a terminal emulator with the following serial port setup. 115200 baud rate, 8 data bits, no parity bit, 1 stop bit.
